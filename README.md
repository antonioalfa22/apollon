Apollon: A Robust Defence System against Adversarial Machine Learning Attacks in Intrusion Detection Systems

## Abstract

The rise of Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) attacks is presenting a significant
challenge to Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and their ability to detect threats. To
address this issue, we introduce Apollon, a novel defence system that can protect IDS
against AML attacks. Apollon utilizes a diverse set of classifiers to identify intrusions
and employs Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) with Thompson sampling to dynamically
select the optimal classifier or ensemble of classifiers for each input. This approach
enables Apollon to prevent attackers from learning the IDS behaviour and generating
adversarial examples that can evade the IDS detection. We evaluate Apollon on
several of the most popular and recent datasets, and show that it can successfully
detect attacks without compromising its performance on traditional network traffic. Our
results suggest that Apollon is a robust defence system against AML attacks in IDS.
