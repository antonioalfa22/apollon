Apollon: A Robust Defence System against Adversarial Machine Learning Attacks in Intrusion Detection Systems

## Abstract

The growing threat of Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) attacks is posing a significant challenge
for the effectiveness of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). In this paper, we propose Apollon, a novel
defence system that can protect IDS against AML attacks. Apollon leverages a set of heterogeneous
classifiers to detect intrusions and applies a Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) model to dynamically select
the optimal classifier or ensemble of classifiers for each input. We evaluate Apollon on several
of the most popular and recent datasets, and show that it can successfully detect attacks without
compromising its performance on normal inputs. We also demonstrate that Apollon can prevent
attackers from learning the IDS behaviour in realistic training times. Our results suggest that Apollon
is an effective and efficient defence system against AML attacks in IDS
